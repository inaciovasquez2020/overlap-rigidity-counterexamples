PSH is used only in rank-bounded form PSH_{k,Δ,r} (r-round k-pebble / FO^k rank ≤ r).
No unbounded-round pebble game, no full FO^k, and no global k-WL stabilization is assumed.

Only r-round / rank-bounded FO^k statements are valid.
Unbounded-round pebble saturation and universal-cover reductions are invalid.
