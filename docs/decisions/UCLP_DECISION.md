# UCLP Decision (Resolved)

The Uniform Constant-Locality Principle (UCLP) is resolved in the negative
for an explicit constant-width SAT family.

An explicit width-3 SAT family with bounded-degree, high-girth factor graph
admits an unconditional Ω(n) transcript-capacity lower bound for any
fixed-radius local transcript.

See supporting construction and proof:

docs/uclp_linear_tc_ldpc.tex

No Ω(n log n) claim is made or required.
