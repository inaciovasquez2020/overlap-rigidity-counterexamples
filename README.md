Status: Frozen baseline (overlap-rigidity-search-v1)
Scope: WL2/WL3 refinement + local cycle-rank stress tests

Overlap Rigidity Counterexample Search

Goal
Search for finite bounded-degree graphs with high local cycle overlap that remain FO/WL homogeneous.

Contents
graphs   finite graph instances
scripts WL and FO-k testers
results empirical outputs
docs    notes and negative findings

Status
Exploratory. No theoretical claims.
