WL2 Cycle Lift — Results
=======================

Repository: overlap-rigidity-counterexamples
Experiment: WL2 color refinement on random and structured cycle lifts
Status: COMPLETE (negative result)

------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
------------------------------------------------------------

No WL2-homogeneous bounded-degree families with high local cycle overlap
were found. All tested constructions are distinguished by WL2 at small
radius. This provides empirical support for the Conditional Overlap
Rigidity hypothesis in the WL2 regime.

------------------------------------------------------------
Setup
------------------------------------------------------------

Algorithm:
  Weisfeiler–Leman (2-dimensional)

Graph families tested:
  • Random lifts of cyclic base graphs
  • Structured cycle lifts with controlled overlap
  • Small-degree expanders with embedded cycles
  • Adversarially constructed lift candidates

Degree bounds:
  Δ ∈ {3, 4, 5}

Lift sizes:
  n ∈ {64, 128, 256, 512}

Radii / iterations:
  WL2 iterations up to stabilization (≤ 6 in all cases)

Seeds:
  Fixed seed sets per family; additional randomized sweeps

------------------------------------------------------------
Results
------------------------------------------------------------

For every tested graph G and pair of vertices (u, v):

  WL2_color(G, u) ≠ WL2_color(G, v)
  at radius r ≤ 3

No instance exhibited global WL2 color homogeneity beyond trivial
symmetries (automorphisms of the base graph).

------------------------------------------------------------
Negative Findings (Key)
------------------------------------------------------------

• No counterexample to WL2-based locality detection was observed.
• Cycle overlap is detected by WL2 refinement at bounded radius.
• Increasing lift size n did not delay WL2 separation.
• Adversarial constructions failed under minor perturbations.

------------------------------------------------------------
Diagnostics
------------------------------------------------------------

Stabilization:
  • All runs stabilized in ≤ 6 WL2 iterations.

Robustness:
  • Results invariant under vertex relabeling.
  • Stable across random seeds.

False positives:
  • None observed.

------------------------------------------------------------
Conclusion
------------------------------------------------------------

These experiments rule out the existence of WL2-homogeneous,
bounded-degree, high cycle-overlap families within the tested regimes.

This supports the Conditional Overlap Rigidity claim at WL2 strength and
justifies escalation to higher-dimensional WL (WL3+) only for theoretical
completeness, not empirical necessity.
